 - NO is only converted to NO2 with sunlight. 
   This could mean that at night, traffic is proportional to NO. 
   We could augment our nighttime baseline values by subtracting NO from them to eliminate all traffic 
   and leave only industry and soil!
 - data has an attribute 'scaleFactor'. Does this mess up our fractions?
